# Stock Study
This repo contains the programs I wrote for studying stocks. 

- `fb.py`: My first attempt of downloading stock prices from Yahoo and some basic processing. 
- `fb.sql`: Migrated to SQL for easier analysis. 

# TODO
- Implement a GUI to display stock price charts of stocks that has surged in price, to study what are the characteristics of stocks that has surged in price. Then test its predictive power. 
The GUI tool should include a list of stocks that surged in price to choose, and for each stock that surged in price (e.g. 5x - 10x) store the time where it surged. When I click on the item in the list of stock tickers, the display chart will display the stock chart at the right time period, along with S&P500 at the same time, and some Google Trends statistics. 
- Use Google Trends to [predict stock prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_prediction#cite_note-3).
